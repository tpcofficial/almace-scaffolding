Security Operation Center's (SOC) help give trained employees rapid-insight into what's happening day-to-day.

With the move to remote working thanks to COVID we need to make security operations and management easier to complete (in a secure way) from home.

Our SOC needed a revamp so here goes nothing!

We aim to build a virtual Security Operations Center using open-source (and some proprietary) software so anyone can watch over their infrastructure from the comfort of their own home.

TPC has had a single SOC based in Greater Manchester which monitors overall client and internal networks/infrastructures. We've had **no** successful cyberattacks affecting ourselves or any of our clients during the now 7 years of operations. We aim to keep this record!

Join us on our adventure to expand our monitoring operations!

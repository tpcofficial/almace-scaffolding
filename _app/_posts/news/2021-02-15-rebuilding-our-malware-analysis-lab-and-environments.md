In 2017 we deployed our first version of our staff's malware environment and analysis labs.

We used these labs to protect our customers, employees and the public for 4 years.

The world has changed, we need to change too. Over the next month, me and two other colleagues are completely rebuilding our tools and environments to help assist us to respond to possible threats faster in this ever-changing modern threat landscape.

We'll try to keep you guys updated on resources we used, articles which inspired us and more!

Thanks for choosing us, let's push to the future together!

_Information on educating yourself in tech fields for free_

# **The search for ________**

As we know, getting into fields like software development, systems management and cybersecurity, are commonly seen as expensive and hard-to-accomplish tasks.

We want to help change that, we're planning to release some small things in our Notes section covering options for free and paid courses in fields to help you make your start on a journey into tech.

I hope to get some friends on-board for this search for education, but at the moment it's just me.

Stay safe out there, go follow your dreams!

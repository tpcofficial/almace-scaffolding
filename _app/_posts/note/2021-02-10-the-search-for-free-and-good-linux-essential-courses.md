title: The search for free and good Linux Essential courses

---
Linux training courses are usually extremely expensive, or extremely bad.

# The search

Spamming contacts, friends and partners to no avail, the hunt is on.

## Paid options

Udemy, Coursera, SANS Foundation and edx are some common (non-specific) providers of courses.

The courses are in depth, some labs and assets to assist you with your studies.

If you have the cash available to invest into a SANS Foundations course then you're going to come out on top of many other students. 
The problem with these providers, are they're expensive as hell.

### Udemy

Udemy is a well known course provider which allows reviewed content to be published to their platform. You can find nearly anything on Udemy with a bit of searching.

There's quite a few Linux courses and I'm going to cover the platform rather than a specific course.

The pros:

- There's a lot of options to chose from for any price range
- Most of the high-rated courses are from people with experience and qualifications in the field
- There are courses specific to distributions and certain topics
- User reviews on ever course
- Udemy-staff picks

The cons:

- Although reviewed, there are still some pretty poor courses with high prices
- No refunds
- Most of the courses barely touch theory
- Big mix between video, text and other content- can't really tell how your course will be structured until after you purchase it
- Certificates are not always included and may cost extra
- Does not offer degrees

### Coursera

Coursera is another online course provider, similar to Udemy.

Where Udemy allows content and courses from the public, Coursera is primarily for companies and universities, they have in-depth courses from the likes of Red Hat, Microsoft, Google and the Linux Foundation.

Most of the content available is also free, even ones from large corporations!

The pros:

- Trusted, in-depth content
- Most of the content is free
- Lots of general and specific courses
- Lots of distro-focused courses
- Free certificate with any course
- Student & enterprise options
- Courses covering bundles of things (e.g. open-source software development from TLF includes Linux, Git, Development fundamentals, what is open-source software etc)
- Degrees available too

The cons:

- You will need to dedicate a lot more time that other providers
- There are *no* labs for non-programming topics

### SANS

The SANS Institute is a well-known name and course by most employers, companies and groups.

SANS Foundation is a new course started with CyberDiscovery which covers the fundamentals of Linux, System security, Source management and more.

The pros:

- Certificates are expensive
- Not all paid courses include certificates



## Free options

There are some great free options available to people out there, most of which are actually very in-depth and great to learn with. All of these do not include labs though, sadly.
